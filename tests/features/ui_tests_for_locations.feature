Feature: Verify header, central screen, and footer are displayed correctly in different locations

  Scenario Outline: Verify header, central screen, and footer for different locations
    Given the game is started
    When I am on the "<location>"
    Then I should see a header with the scoreboard
    And I should see the central screen with the location image and description
      | description                                        |
      | <description>                                      |
    And I should see a footer with action buttons
      | buttons                                            |
      | <buttons>                                          |
    And I should see the "Full screen" option in the top-right corner

  Examples:
    | location                     | description                                                                              | buttons                                     |
